484,missing root,I’m not sure about this alignment because the way it is right now would mean that for ‘no hace frío’ there is no root in Huarayo.
470,different,different alignment for Cavineña ‘nuera’?
64,three points,"there is a entry in prototakana that is ba… for shoulder. The other three entries have this root plus something else ?axa, ?aha, or tha. Maybe it’s the case that the word for ‘shoulder’ is also this formative that couldn’t be reconstructed for the protolanguage? if that’s the case, how should one addressed this in edictor with the alignments?"
68,elbow,"following the last Q, it seems that the word for ‘elbow’ is the root for ‘shoulder’ ba plus a tru morpheme."
47,arm,"the word for ‘brazo’ is bai so taking in consideeration these three concepts, the panorama should be clearer"
358,o,perhaps the final o in the proposed stem for Huarayo is not correct and the stemm would be only pi
95,morpheme part of root?,"It is indicated from the original source that he is a morpheme. Could it be part of the root, however? the data from prototakana signals a beake form for ‘encima’ and this is pretty sistematic through out the data. There is however a hi or hu morpheme in Cavivena and possibly in Huarayo."
101,metatesis,"For Caviveña there are three words for the concept, one of which seems to have metatesis on the root. How should we addressed this?"
136,tsha,is this transcription okay for Sapibokona?
141,phonemes,"what are the phonemes for tr-,tsch- in Maropa?"
149,metatesis,"once again, what to do with metatesis?"
178,three points,"The same problem with the three points, maybe here the protoform was something like didi?"
